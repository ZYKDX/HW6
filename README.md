Chess Game Rules:
Each chess piece can move in a specific way. 
In addition to moving, each chess piece can also kill a chess piece of the opposite color if it moves to its place. The rules for each chess piece are as follows:

Bishop: A bishop can only move diagonally, and kill any opponent’s piece if it can move to its place.

Knight: A knight can move only in an L pattern: two cells horizontally and one vertically or vice versa. It can kill any opponent’s piece if it can move to its place.

Queen: A queen can move horizontally, vertically and diagonally. It can kill any opponent’s piece if it can move to its place.

Rook: A rook can move horizontally or vertically. It can kill any opponent’s piece if it can move to its place.

Pawn: A pawn is interesting: it can move only “ahead”, not backwards towards where its color started. It can move only one place forward in its own column. However to kill it must move one place forward diagonally (it cannot kill by moving straight).


Description of our work:

1. Junit Test is used for test each role can kill or move.
2. We consider to refinement the test to the test package after the deadline.
3.Source files are one interface(contains abstract methods）, five chess pieces type classes(implement the ChessPiece interface), five demo classes and five Junit test classes. 
4.For this homework, please follow the row and clo's recognition way: we consider row start from south, and clo from left.
